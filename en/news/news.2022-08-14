## 2022-08-14 - Allegro has a discord server!

Some members of the community set up a discord server as a more modern
alternative to the IRC [#allegro](irc.html) channel and
[allegro.cc](https://www.allegro.cc/) forums. Rest assured, the IRC channel
isn't going away, but it is nice to have options for those not wanting to deal
with IRC limitations. Join it [here](https://discord.gg/f3Cd4TZzpp)!
