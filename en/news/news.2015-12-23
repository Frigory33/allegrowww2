## 2015-12-23 - Allegro on NuGet!

Allegro is now packaged by [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Allegro/)!

Currently only MSVC 2015 is supported, but stay tuned as we figure out what set of platforms and build types to support.

Follow the tutorial [here](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro_wiki/wiki/Allegro-in-Visual-Studio#using-nuget-within-visual-studio) to test it out.
